Hi Team,

I am working on the following stories in this sprint:

XWTQ-7360 – Test Records Retention Purge (Sprint 18) – Completed

XWTQ-7479 – Test Records Retention Purge Part 2 (Sprint 19) – Created for new requirements

XWTQ-7207 – NFR Tracking Error Number in WIOPS (Sprint 19)

XWTQ-6265 – WIOPS Production Support for Spring 6 Upgrade (Sprint 19) – Completed

As we discussed in today’s connect, as committed, I worked on XWTQ-7360 in Sprint 18. I resolved all the outstanding issues and successfully tested both the purge and rollback scripts.

During testing, we sought clarification on cases where an inactive obligor has an active loan less than 10 years old. In this scenario, the inactive obligor was purged but not the loan. After further discussion, the product team introduced a new requirement and created XWTQ-7479 in Sprint 19. This is time-consuming and may result in another story being created as well.

Please find the latest requirements below, and also find the attached document for peer review. Kindly go through it and share your feedback.
