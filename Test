I have been with Wells Fargo for the past 10 years and have contributed across multiple projects, most recently as a Lead Software Engineer. During this period, I have consistently strived to deliver quality outcomes and support the organization’s goals.

After moving to a new manager due to the reallocation of applications, my performance ratings have unfortunately declined despite my sincere efforts to improve. I have been placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), and after careful consideration, I believe it may be best for me to move on from the organization.

Given my long tenure and contributions, I kindly request HR’s support in considering a severance package that would help me manage my financial needs during this transition.

I would appreciate your guidance on the next steps and any options that may be available to me.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
